Here is my [C.V.](https://arturoestrada.github.io/CVArturoEstrada.pdf) 

## Research Interests

I conduct research in the area of *Behavioral Operations Management*. I study how the design and operation of service systems influence human behavior and decision-making. My research focuses on the development of game-theoretic models and the design of lab experiments to collect and analyze human behavior data. In particular, I study persuasion, deception, and lying behavior.
