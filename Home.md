I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Management at the [School of Management](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), supervised by [Rouba Ibrahim](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/people/roubaibrahim) and [Dongyuan Zhan](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk/people/dongyuanzhan). 

Here is my [C.V.](https://arturoestrada.github.io/CVArturoEstrada.pdf) 

## Research Interests

I conduct research in the area of *Behavioral Operations Management*. I study how persuasion, deception, and lying behavior from both managers and customers impact the performance of service systems. I employ game-theoretic models and design lab experiments to analyze decision-making and human behavior data. My research derives insights and nuanced strategies to design and implement optimal operational policies in response to deceptive behavioral tendencies.
