<h2>Research Interests</h2> 

My research focuses on information economics in the context of service operations and queueing systems. 
I study priority allocation problems with (dis-)honest customer data,
non-truthful mechanism design for revenue management, delay announcements under cheap talk and bayesian persuasion, 
and diagnostic queueing systems with human-algorithm interactions.  
I apply queueing models, game-theoretic models, and econometric analysis of experimental data.
