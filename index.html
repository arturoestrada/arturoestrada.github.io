<h2>Research Interests</h2> 

I conduct research in the area of <em>Behavioral Operations Management</em>. I study how persuasion, deception, and lying behavior from both managers and customers impact the performance of service systems. I employ game-theoretic models and design lab experiments to analyze decision-making and human behavior data. My research derives insights and nuanced strategies to design and implement optimal operational policies in response to deceptive behavioral tendencies.
