<h2>Research Interests</h2> 

My dissertation research focuses on applying queueing models, game-theoretic models, and econometric analysis of experimental data to formulate actionable policy recommendations for service operations. In particular, I study the way customers and managers in service systems strategically exchange private information to influence each other's beliefs and decisions, and how these strategic interactions affect the system's overall performance.
