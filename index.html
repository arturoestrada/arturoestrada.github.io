<h2>Research Interests</h2> 

My dissertation research <i>Strategic Information Disclosure in Service Operations: A Theoretical and Experimental Study</i>, conducted under the supervision of Rouba Ibrahim and Dongyuan Zhan, focuses on <i>formulating actionable policy recommendations for service operations</i>. In the context of service systems, I study customer lying/misreporting in priority allocation problems, manager cheap talk and persuasive delay announcements in information design problems, and strategic human-algorithm communication in machine-based recommendation problems. I apply queueing models, game-theoretic models, and econometric analysis of experimental data, to study the way relevant players in service systems strategically use, share, and manipulate private information to influence each other's beliefs and decisions, and how these strategic interactions affect the system's overall performance.
